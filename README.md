### Api-Gateway.
This will redirect routing requests from frontend to the respective microservices. After the microservices execute their functions, the gateway will again pass the JSON data back to the frontend through which UI changes will occur. It will basically serve as an intermediary between the frontend and the microservices executing in the backend.
