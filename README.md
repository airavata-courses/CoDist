This project provides an interface to plot historical data provided by NEXRAD AWS based on the user’s input (date, time and radar fields). It makes use of  a microservice based architecture to allocate separate functionality to each microservice.

The provided functionalities include user registration, logging history, editable inputs and the plotting image.
